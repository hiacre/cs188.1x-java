        Search the deepest nodes in the search tree first

        Your search algorithm needs to return a list of actions that reaches
        the goal.  Make sure to implement a graph search algorithm

        To get started, you might want to try some of these simple commands to
        understand the search problem that is being passed in:

        print "Start:", problem.getStartState()
        print "Is the start a goal?", problem.isGoalState(problem.getStartState())
        print "Start's successors:", problem.getSuccessors(problem.getStartState())
        **/
        
        /*** YOUR CODE HERE ***/
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
    }
    
}
