Something is weird and screwy about positions and vectors.  It's not clear which
positions are grid-based (entirely integers), and which are... sub-grid-based (floats).

Evidence

getPossibleActions
==================
Gets a configuration's x and y.
It feels the need to round x and y to the nearest integers.
If these floats and integers are outside a certain tolerance, then configuration's direction is returned.
   The direction is whatever was given to configuration.




A Search is an object that implements a search algorithm.
The algorithm is called via getActions, and it takes a SearchProblem.

Problems
========
What is a problem?
