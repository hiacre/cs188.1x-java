An AgentState is told whether it is Pacman when it is first created.

An agentPosition is simply a tuple of either (int, position) or (boolean, position).
When int == 0, boolean is true, then the agentPosition is Pacman.
When int == 1, the agent is a ghost.  There can be multiple 1s.
Also, int == 2,3,4 are ghosts as well, it seems.
  I think these various numbering options are for sortability.
